## Course Description:

This course provides a critical introduction to the study and application of some of the major concepts and themes of human geography including historical, regional, urban, social and cultural geographies. This course invites students to think critically and creatively about some deeply ingrained assumptions concerning nature and environment as they appear in social, political, cultural, and ethical debate. In this course we draw upon a range of geographic research methods to investigate geographic phenomena, especially human-environment relations.
